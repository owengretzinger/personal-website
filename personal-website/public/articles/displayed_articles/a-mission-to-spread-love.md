You may have read my website headline and wondered what I meant by being "on a mission to spread love". Allow me to explain.

## Where I Came From 

In grade 10 I took a "computer studies" course and immediately began to love coding. Something about being able to type some instructions and have my creation light up on a screen was so captivating to me (and still is). At that time playing video games was one of my hobbies, and my limited introduction to programming sparked an idea for a little game I wanted to create myself.

Later that year I downloaded a game engine called [Unity](https://unity.com), and immediately got to work on this game, which later became [Triangle Ball](/articles/triangle-ball). Over the next few years, I worked on this game intermittently, creating many others along the way. I remember when I first started working on the game, I didn't even know what a for-loop was, but by a few years in I was applying integrals from calculus class in order for the bots to be able to predict exactly where the ball will go and how long it will take to get there. ([More information on my full project overview!](/articles/triangle-ball)) I learned a tremendous amount and am glad to have created games.

## Where I Am Now 

So what does this have to do with anything?

In 2021 I decided I loved coding so much that I would pursue computer science in university. As I have gotten older, my values have changed slightly, alongside what I spend my time doing, and what I spend my time coding. I no longer play video games because while there can be value in connecting with friends over a game, I have found that they are a waste of time for the most part, especially when playing alone. I never played an excessive amount, but if I could turn back time, I would spend my time elsewhere.

And if I don't play video games because they are a waste of time (according to me), then it wouldn't make sense for me to continue developing games. Now, as mentioned, I am glad to have created the games I did. It was really fun which gave me the desire and motivation to learn how to code. However, especially since I started my second year of university, I have focused on other things that I think are more important. At the time of writing this I am on co-op at a cybersecurity company called [Arctic Wolf](https://arcticwolf.com), where I develop tools that make a meaningful impact. (The views expressed on this site are obviously my own and do not necessarily reflect those of Arctic Wolf.) This shift is also demonstrated by the difference between me making a game for a hackathon in September 2022 (Tempestuous Turrets) versus making a website to display education data for a hackathon in January 2023 ([Education Data for Change](/articles/education-data-for-change)).

Another very important aspect of this change for me is my faith. Especially during my second year of university (the year leading up to writing this), I have found that Jesus is reliable and that has greatly impacted my life. Now more than ever, I want to use my skills for things that matter in order to love people like Jesus loved. (And if any of that is confusing, I'm always open to dialogue!)

## Where I'm Going 

This may all seem like a lot of talk considering there are still multiple games among the projects listed in my [projects section](/projects). However, moving forward my plan and my commitment is to being thoughtful of what I spend my time doing. I am actively refining what it looks like to use the skills I have to spread love, and I enjoy gaining insights from others about the best way to do that. In the end, I aim to make a meaningful impact and keep my mission of spreading love at the center of what I do.
