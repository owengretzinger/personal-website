As described in [A Mission To Spread Love?](/articles/a-mission-to-spread-love), soon after I learned about programming for the first time in grade 10, I got the idea for this 2D physics-based sports game where players would control triangles and try to score on each other.

At first, I didn't even know how to write a for-loop, but after a few years of working on-and-off, tens of thousands of lines of code, and a full restart from scratch later, I can safely say that this is the biggest project I have ever created.

I learned a tremendous amount over the course of making Triangle Ball, including [completion of the Unity Junior Programmer pathway](https://www.credly.com/badges/13fe0e9d-c5ea-4e5a-bc1d-30aec8ce410d/) (link to certification) and the creation of many other projects. I also created all of the art for the game, which was a great experience!

## Bots

I am especially proud of the bots I programmed, as I used calculus that I was learning in first year so that the bots can predict exactly where and when they will get to the ball (see the picture above where the ball is about to bounce off the wall).Â 

## Technologies 

The game was created using [Unity](https://unity.com) and C#.
