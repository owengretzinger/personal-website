I have purposely kept the amount of resources in each category very low. Only the best of the best are included!

## Podcasts

**1.** [**Becoming Something with Jonathan Pokluda**](https://linktr.ee/becomingsomething)

BeSo has made a huge impact on my faith. JP supports everything he says with memorized scripture, I love the humour, and the hosts are authentic. I also really like how one of the other hosts (Nate) asks the questions we're all thinking; they don't shy away from hard topics.

I would recommend just scrolling through until you see an interesting topic since they're all great, but these are some of my favourites (Spotify links):

- [Episode 10: Social Media](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6kTcLtGObb2EkXMXFAIeyD?si=68c74f713b354289)
- [Episode 80: Can you be just friends with the opposite sex?](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2tYYUTBiOseTYI3nY5wzrY?si=3b02de22cc9e438f)
- [Episode 111: Why Pride Will Ruin Your Life](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0RkJ8sY6u4EKc9CdVTVi3X?si=005ebb74f54944b7)
- [Episode 203: A Conversation With A Former P\*rn Star (feat. Joshua Broome)](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ZxIi17DpyYPOiIA0vz4X7?si=af85b59fe052406e)

## Books 

If you want to read any of these books but price is an issue, I'll happily pay for it or let you borrow a copy. Just [let me know](/contact)!

**1.** [**The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren**](https://www.amazon.ca/Purpose-Driven-Life-What-Earth/dp/031033750X) 

The book is split into 40 days and is meant to be read one chapter a day. The writing style is really easy to read but also very engaging and information-packed. It's a classic that I continually refer back to. [You can get a preview of the first few chapters here](https://www.purposedriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SAMPLE_PDLExpanded.pdf).

**2.** [**Why Do I Do What I Don't Want To Do by Jonathan Pokluda**](https://www.amazon.ca/Why-What-Dont-Want-Life-Giving/dp/0801094968)

The table of contents speaks for itself:

- Part 1: The Ancient Battles
	- Pride & Humility
	- Anger & Forgiveness
	- Greed & Generosity
	- Apathy & Diligence
	- Lust & Self-Control
- Part 2: The Modern Wars
	- Perception Management & Authenticity
	- Entitlement & Gratitude
	- Busyness & Rest
	- Drunkenness & Sobriety
	- Cynicism & Optimism

Every point made is base on scripture, it's applicable, it's interesting, it's authentic, and it's funny. I also love JPs other books [Outdated](https://www.amazon.ca/Outdated-Jonathan-JP-Pokluda/dp/080109495X) and [Welcome To Adulting](https://www.amazon.ca/Welcome-Adulting-Navigating-Friendship-Finances/dp/0801078105)!
