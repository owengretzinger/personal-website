While I was designing this website ([more information here](/articles/personal-website)), I looked at many websites to draw inspiration from. Here are some of my favourites, as well as other websites that I think are awesome and worth including! My hope is that you will be inspired too.

# Crazy Awesome Websites

I also came across some websites that I did not necessarily take inspiration from, but I was so amazed that some of these things could even run in a web browser so I had to include them.
