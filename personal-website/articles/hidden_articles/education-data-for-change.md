Education Data for Change is a website that was created for [DeltaHacks](https://deltahacks.com/) IX with two others, which I then improved over the following days. 

## About The Site

The website allows users to search for schools in Ontario (pictured above) and view EQAO and income data (pictured below).

 The end goal is revealing inequities in the education system in order to make informed decisions about which schools may need more support.

## Technologies 

The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)), in addition to using Python (with MatPlotLib) and SQL (with MongoDB) to create the graphs (pictured above). 

## Conclusion + Bonus Picture 

The hackathon was a great learning experience because we used many different technologies and faced many challenges getting these technologies to work together. It was also fun to hang out with my team, even if they fell asleep on me!
