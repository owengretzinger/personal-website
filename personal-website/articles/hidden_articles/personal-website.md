After I accepted my co-op offer at [Arctic Wolf](https://arcticwolf.com), I learned that I would be using react with typescript. I thought it would be a good idea to get some practice, so between the end of my second year of school and the start of my co-op, I spent some time creating what you are seeing now!

## Process 

When I decided I wanted to create a new personal website (I had previously made one using [Bootstrap Studio](https://bootstrapstudio.io/)), I first searched up examples of what other people had done to gather inspiration. You can see some of these websites in my [personal website inspiration](/articles/personal-website-inspiration) article!

Once I had some ideas, I started drawing them out as shown above. The first draft for these starting sections might look familiar to you if you've seen this website's [homepage](/)! This step helped me get a rough idea of the website layout and what content I wanted to include.

Then, once I thought the rough draft looked okay, I created the design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) as shown above. Figma was a game changer! It's is super easy and quick to use, which meant I could tinker with small details and get things to look exactly right before writing any code.

When it came time to writing the code, I made everything look exactly like my Figma design. Not having to worry about the design in this stage saved tons of time and allowed me to focus more on things like animations, responsive design, and learning react. (Sidenoteâ€”feel free to check out the [github repository](https://github.com/owengretzinger/personal-website) to see all of the code!)

## Challenges 

Since I was relatively new to web development before creating this website, some features were difficult for me to implement and took lots of determination! The loading animation, the sticky navigation bar, and auto-formatting markdown into articles are examples of things that were especially tricky. In the end, I was able to implement everything I envisioned, and am very happy with the result.

## Technologies 

As mentioned, I created this website using react with typescript. I also used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
