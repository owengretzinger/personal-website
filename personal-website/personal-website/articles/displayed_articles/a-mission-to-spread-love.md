You may have read my website headline and wondered what I meant by being "on a mission to spread love". Allow me to explain.

## Where I Came From 

In grade 10 I took a "computer studies" course and immediately fell in love with coding. Something about being able to type some instructions and have my creation light up on the screen was so captivating to me (and still is). At that time playing video games was one of my hobbies, and my limited introduction to programming sparked an idea for a little game I wanted to create myself.

Later that year I downloaded a game engine called [Unity](https://unity.com), and immediately got to work on this game, which later became [Triangle Ball](/articles/triangle-ball). Over the next few years, I worked on this game intermittently, creating many others along the way. I remember when I first started working on the game, I didn't even know what a for-loop was, but by a few years in I was applying integrals from calculus class in order for the bots to be able to predict exactly where the ball will go and how long it will take to get there. ([More information on my full project overview!](/articles/triangle-ball)) I learned a tremendous amount and am glad to have created games.

## Where I Am Now 

So what does this have to do with anything?

In 2021 I decided I loved coding so much that I would pursue computer science in university. As I have gotten older, my values have changed slightly, alongside what I spend my time doing, and what I spend my time coding. I no longer play video games whatsoever because while I agree that there can be value in connecting with friends over a game, I have found that it is a waste of time for the most part. I never played an excessive amount, but if I could go back, I would spend my time elsewhere.

And if I don't play video games because they are a waste of time (according to me), then it wouldn't make sense for me to continue developing games. Now, as mentioned, I am glad to have created the games I did. It was really fun which gave me the desire and motivation to learn how to code. However, especially over the course of this past school year, I have been focusing on other things that I think are more important. At the time of writing this I just started a co-op at a cybersecurity company [Arctic Wolf](https://arcticwolf.com), where I will be able to make a meaningful impact. Another way this shift is demonstrated is the difference between me [making a game for a hackathon in September](/articles/tempestuous-turrets) versus [making a website to display education data for a hackathon in January](/articles/education-data-for-change).

Another very important aspect of this change for me is my faith. I have been a "christian" my whole life, but over the past year especially, Jesus has transformed my life. Now more than ever, I want to use my passion for coding for things that really matter. If you have any questions about this or are curious to know more, [let me know](/contact) and I would be happy to explain further!

## Where I'm Going 

This may all seem like a lot of talk considering there are still multiple games among the projects I list in my [projects section](/projects). However, moving forward my plan and my commitment is to being thoughtful of what I spend my time doing. I want to make the most of my limited time, removing any distractions in order to make a meaningful impact and to keep my mission of spreading love at the center of what I do.
