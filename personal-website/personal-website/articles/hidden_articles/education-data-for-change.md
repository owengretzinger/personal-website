Education Data for Change is a website that was created for DeltaHacks IX with two others, then I improved  it over the following days. It allows users to search for schools in Ontario and view EQAO and income data, with the end goal of revealing inequities in the education system to make informed decisions about which schools may need more support. The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS), in addition to using Python (with MatPlotLib) and SQL (with MongoDB) to create the graphs (4th slide). The hackathon was a great learning experience because we used many different technologies and faced many challenges using these technologies together to create one cohesive website!
