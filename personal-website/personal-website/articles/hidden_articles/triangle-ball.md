When I was first learning to code in high school, I got the idea for a 2D-physics-based-sports-game where players would control triangles and try to score on each other. Shortly thereafter, I started pursuing this idea using Unity and C#. At first, I didn't even know how to write a for-loop, but after a few years of working on-and-off, tens of thousands of lines of code, and a full restart from scratch later, I have created my biggest personal project ever!

I am especially proud of the bots I programmed which you can play against, as I used calculus I was learning in first year so that the bots can predict exactly where and when they will get to the ball (see the 3rd picture). I also created everything for the game including all of the art!
