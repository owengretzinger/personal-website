I have purposely kept the amount of resources in each category very low. Only the best of the best are included!

## Podcasts

[Becoming Something with Jonathan Pokluda (Linktree)](https://linktr.ee/becomingsomething)

- I purposely put this at the top. Specifically targeted towards young adults, BeSo has made a huge impact on my faith. It talks about all the questions young adults have, which has really helped since a lot of these topics were never talked about in church for me growing up (at least when I was listening haha). JP supports everything he says with memorized scripture, I really like the humour, and the hosts are authentic. I would recommend just scrolling through until you see an interesting topic since they're all great, but some of my favourites are [Episode 10: Social Media](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6kTcLtGObb2EkXMXFAIeyD?si=68c74f713b354289), [Episode 80: Can you be just friends with the opposite sex?](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2tYYUTBiOseTYI3nY5wzrY?si=3b02de22cc9e438f), [Episode 111: Why Pride Will Ruin Your Life](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0RkJ8sY6u4EKc9CdVTVi3X?si=005ebb74f54944b7), and [Episode 203: A Conversation With A Former P\*rn Star (feat. Joshua Broome)](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ZxIi17DpyYPOiIA0vz4X7?si=af85b59fe052406e) (spotify links).

## Books 

If you commit to reading any of these books, I'll happily pay. Just [let me know](/#contact)!

[Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren]() 

- The book is split into 40 days and is meant to be read one chapter a day. The writing style is really easy to read but also very engaging and information-packed. It's a classic that I continually refer back to. [You can get a preview of the first few chapters here]().

[Why Do I Do What I Don't Want To Do by Jonathan Pokluda]()

- Or WDIDWIDWTD for short! (Or long?) The book is split into two parts with five chapters each. The first is "The Ancient Battles", which has chapters titled "Pride & Humility", "Anger & Forgiveness", "Greed & Generosity", "Apathy & Diligence", and "Lust & Self-Control". The second is is "The Modern Wars", which has chapters titled "Perception Management & Authenticity", "Entitlement & Gratitude", "Busyness & Rest", "Drunkenness & Sobriety", and "Cynicism & Optimism". It's all based on scripture, it's applicable, it's interesting, it's authentic, and it's funny. I also love JPs other books [Outdated]() and [Welcome To Adulting]()!

## Movies/Shows 

Christian media that's actually really good!

- The show really captures everything about Jesus so well. I can't recommend it enough, and you can watch it for free!
