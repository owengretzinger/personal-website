# Personal Website Inspiration

While I was designing this website (which I did using [Figma](https://figma.com)), I looked at many other websites to draw inspiration from. Here are some of my favourites.

## Websites That Inspired Me

### 1. [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com)

Don't look too hard or you'll think my website is just a copy of hers! I really liked a lot of the things she's done with her website, like the link animations and nav bar.

### 2. [Olaolu Olawuyi](https://olaolu.dev/)

I really like the purple and lime colour scheme on Olaolu's website, and originally I wanted to do a similar thing but with pastel colours. The header section pictured above was definitely an inspiration for me, especially how it collapses down on mobile.

### 3. [Lynn Fisher](https://lynnandtonic.com/)

I was really impressed with Lynn's website and the things she has created with CSS. She also has an archive of many versions of her website over the years, and my blue wavy design was inspired by the [2020 archive](https://lynnandtonic.com/archive/2020/)'s first portfolio section.

### 4. [Adenekan Wonderful](https://www.codewonders.dev/)

He's cool.

## Crazy Websites Too Good Not To Include

I also came across some that I did not take inspiration from, but were so cool I had to include them here.

### 1. [Bruno Simon](https://bruno-simon.com/)

This one is so cool. When I used to make video games I had dreams of creating an interactive experience like Bruno has. It's honestly super impressive that it even runs this well in a web browser!
